# 7. Vendor Interactions

## Goals

* To answer all vendor questions.
* To treat all vendors equally, fairly and respectfully.
* To prevent unfair advantage through transparent information disclosure.
* To become familiar with the solutions that bidders are offering.

## Actions

### Actively communicating

It is important to communicate effectively in order to support an RFP once it has been published. Good communications will build trust with vendors (and the public) and will increase the quantity and quality of bids. It will also reduce the barriers to bidding, welcoming in new vendors with higher-quality solutions. Finally, communications are a good way to add nuance to the RFP in a way that helps bidders align with the underlying (implicit) goals, values, and objectives that are motivating the project.

* Plain, clear language (without jargon and without assumptions)
* Consistent message (focus on the content of the RFP)
* Go out into the community and actively engage

### Using the right channels

Circulating the RFP broadly, in the right channels, is crucial.

* Identify the primary audiences that this RFP should reach (based on market research)
* Adapt messaging for specific audiences (e.g. incumbent firms, technical experts, startup companies)
* Use the following channels:
  * Existing outreach platforms (such as the city register and formal government RFP listings)
  * Unconventional channels (Twitter, software groups like Code for America, and listings like CityMart).
  * Host an event or demo day.
  * Go out to industry meetings or events.

### Answering questions

A good vendor will often need to ask clarifying questions in order to write a technical bid that satisfies your technical requirements and problem statement.

* Have a clear channel for vendors to submit clarification questions.
* Any answers you give to one vendor should be published for all vendors to access.
* Ensure that answers are clear and consistent throughout the RFP bidding timeframe.

### Hosting workshops and demonstrations

If there is a strong market for existing solutions, you may want to get first hand experience with the products and vendors.

* Consider hosting a workshop that all potential bidders are welcome to attend. During the workshop, walk through the user journeys, play out scenarios, describe the problem statement and KPIs. Put a recording online.
* Schedule two-part meetings: include demos for frontline staff (so they can see what their day to day would be like). Then bring in the technical staff so they can ask questions like security and database architecture.
* Never use NDAs.

## Common challenges

### Inconsistent messaging

In some cases, city staff answer the same question differently throughout an RFP bidding timeframe. Avoid inconsistency by aligning internally, having a single point of contact for the RFP, and publishing all questions and answers.

### Hesitance to engage with vendors

There is a common assumption that interacting with vendors is forbidden or illegal. It isnâ€™t! The ground rules of procurement are fairness, objectivity and transparency. As long as you adhere to those principles when you interact with vendors, there is significant opportunity for creativity.
